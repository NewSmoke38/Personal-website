  <h2>Life's melancholy</h2>

    <h5>21 june, 24</h5>
    <p>So this is about thinking beyond. if we think about it, finding the meaning of our lives is as hard as catcing a shooting star. to think of it is like trying to get sunlight in our eyes but without a know sun. so for now i'll just leave it to the songs i listen to and the pinkish color i sometimes see in the sky. *sigh*</p>
